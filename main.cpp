/* Simple desktop gamepad for TRIK on C++/Qt.
 * Gamepad can be thought as a set of additional sensors for robot, which can be accessed from scripts, so there is no
 * intrinsic behavior associated with gamepad commands. To see that gamepad actually does something it is needed
 * to write a script that uses it or to use already written program, like "remoteControl" from TRIK Studio examples.
 *
 * TRIK gamepad is active when TRIK GUI is launched (and gamepad is enabled in config files, which is true by default).
 * It listens port 4444 (by default, can be changed in configs) and accepts following commands:
 * * pad <id> <x> <y>  --- pad with given id is pressed in (x, y) point. Valid ids are 1 for left pad and 2 for right
 *       pad, coordinates are from -100 to 100, where -100 is on top (or to the left) and 100 is bottom or right
 *       of a pad.
 * * pad <id> up  --- pad with given id is released. Valid ids are 1 for left pad and 2 for right pad.
 * * btn <id>  --- "magic button" with given id is pressed. Valid ids are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
 * * wheel <percent>  --- tilt of a gamepad reported by gyroscope. Valid percents are in range [-100, 100], where -100
 *       corresponds to maximum left tilt, 100 --- maximum right. Wheel commands are not shown in this example to keep
 *       it simple.
 * All commands are separated by '\n' symbol. So example of a data packet sent to a robot for "pad" command is
 * "pad 1 0 -100\n", excluding quotes.
